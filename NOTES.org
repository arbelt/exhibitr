* Alternative specifications

** Underlying representation

Currently lightweight S3 class; could be made into S4 or R6.

- S4 would give a little more built-in consistency checking, but possibly at the
  expense of flexibility
- R6 would give quite a bit more structure and perhaps make it easier to "fill
  in" methods for non-supplied formats. Also could use accessor functions to
  ensure that types, at least, are correct
  - built-in dictionary of render methods?

* Interface

- Create data filter elements
- Generate =tagList= of other elements
